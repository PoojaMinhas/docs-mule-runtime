| xref:dw-periods-functions-between.adoc[between] | Returns a Period consisting of the number of years, months,
and days between two dates.
The start date is included, but the end date is not.
The period is calculated by removing complete months, then calculating
the remaining number of days, adjusting to ensure that both have the same sign.
The number of months is then split into years and months based on a 12 month year.
A month is considered if the end day-of-month is greater than or equal to the start day-of-month.
For example, from `2010-01-15` to `2011-03-18` is one year, two months and three days.
The result of this method can be a negative period if the end is before the start.
