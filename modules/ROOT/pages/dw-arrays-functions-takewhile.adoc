[[takewhile1]]
== takeWhile&#40;Array<T&#62;, &#40;item: T&#41; &#45;&#62; Boolean&#41;: Array<T&#62;

Selects elements from the array while the condition is met but
stops the selection process when it reaches an element that 
fails to satisfy the condition.


To select all elements that meet the condition, use the `filter` function.

_Introduced in DataWeave 2.2.0. Supported by Mule 4.2 and later._

=== Parameters

[%header, cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `array` | The array of elements.
| `condition` | The condition (or expression) used to match an element in the array.
|===

=== Example

This example iterates over the elements in the array and selects only those
where in index is `&lt;= 2` and stops selecting elements when it reaches  
one that is greater than 2. Notice that it does not select the 3 because 4 
precedes 3 in the array. The function outputs the result into an array.
